#### About MSSA
The Microsoft Software and Systems Academy (MSSA) is a 17-week technical training program for transitioning service members and veterans, designed to prepare participants for careers in the technology industry.

This repository showcases my progress through the **Cloud Application Development (CAD)** learning path, focusing on software engineering and application development skills.

#### Course Details
- **Course Start**: January 13th, 2025  
- **Course End**: May 2025  
- **Track**: Cloud Application Development (PCAD16)

#### Repository Structure
The repository is organized by weeks and days:
```
WeekX/DayX/WXDXCX
```
- **WeekX**: The week of the course (e.g., `week1`, `week2`, etc.).
- **DayX**: The specific day of the week (e.g., `Day1`, `Day2`, etc.).
- **WXDXCX**: The code file(s) produced on that specific day. Each code file is numbered sequentially (e.g., `W1D1C1`, `W1D1C2`).

#### Example
```
Week1/  
  Day1/  
    W1D1C1  
    W1D1C2  
  Day2/  
    W1D2C1  
Week2/  
  Day1/  
    W2D1C1  
```

#### Updates
I will upload new files as I progress through the program. Stay tuned for daily updates and code samples!
